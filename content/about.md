# 👋, Harish here!!

I'm a `Machine Learning Engineer` 💻 passionate and curious in solving real 🌏 problems.

Always enthusiastic about learning new technologies and build on those technologies (even a Simple _`print("Hello, World!!")`_).

When not tinkering with data and models, you will probably find me relishing 🎧, watching 📺, researching 📚, or hiking 🗻.

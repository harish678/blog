## **Introduction**

Context managers allow you to allocate and release resources precisely when you want to. The most widely used example of context managers is the `with` statement.

Suppose you have two related operations which youâ€™d like to execute as a pair, with a block of code in between. Context managers allow you to do specifically that.

## **Implementaion**

In the below example we will implement a program to open the file and read its contents using two methods.

### <u>Method 1</u>

An object can be a Context Manager if we add `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.

### <u>Method 2</u>

Can create a Context Manager using `@contextmanager` decorator [^1].

The function being decorated must return a `generator-iterator` when called.
